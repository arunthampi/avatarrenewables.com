          SMARTCOMM has several powerful features to improve pump operation and maintenance in the artificial-lift O & G industry. After all, production solely depend on the optimal run-time and lowest down-times.        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Up to eight important TRIP signals can be hooked-up to capture data to narrow down the root cause of failure.  Hence, efficient deployment of maintenance crew is possible and mean-time-to-repair (MTTR) is substantially reduced. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Modbus RTU slave functionality to convey trip data captured from the motor control panel.
        </li>
        <li>
            The “first-in” feature to pick trip-cause.
        </li>
        <li>
            Timer-function to enable a timer well to be run in operator mode during controller or sensor failure thereby lower production loss otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Self-powered for over 30 minutes@30 watts during a power outage to accomplish all of the above functionalities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          It is a well-known fact that incorrect deployment of maintenance discipline for trouble shooting causes delays in restarting a production well. A speedy problem rectification reduces the pump down-time. To the best of our knowledge and experience, if implemented on 500 beam lift pumps (each 50M3/D NET OIL average) could save over $1 million/month (@70USD/barrel) and also, about 30% deferment is caused due to field power outages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note: </strong>SMARTCOMM has a very wide application and can find use in windfarms, tidal farms, power plants, CNC machines etc.

      <h4>Features</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Since the failure cause is more specifically captured by SMARTCOMM, prioritization, planning, scheduling and job notification (or request) can be made optimally by routing it to the appropriate maintenance discipline/section. This improves the <strong>mean-time-to-repair (MTTR)</strong> and thus saves the company from losses due to deferring. The cause specifics also help in conducting <strong>effective RCAs</strong> (root cause analysis) for equipment reliability and sustainability.
        </li>
        <li>
            SMARTCOMM has a <strong>non-intrusive two-wire power path (unlike 4-wire, two in and two out).</strong> Technically, it operates parallel to the existing power system and cuts-in automatically, without break during a power outage. Also, connecting or disconnecting SMARTCOMM will not interrupt an existing powered working equipment. 
        </li>
        <li>
          SMARTCOMM has in-built <strong>special function</strong> which saves deferment in Beam-lift <strong>TIMER-WELLS</strong>. Timer wells will have to be necessarily put down in the event of a pump “controller/load/position/rpm” failure to avoid damage due to continuous dry run. This feature in the device is <strong>operator selectable</strong> where the device bypasses the controller and automatically commands pump operation based on average pump ON-OFF cycles. The RUN/IDLE times are automatically calculated. The well can thus be <strong>run temporarily by an operator until the controller issue is resolved.</strong> This will improve production and also, it is safe and in no way interlinked with the pump safeguarding system.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Provision for up to <strong>8 local digital (TRIP)</strong> inputs to capture trip-initiations are available and the data can be transmitted over an <strong>RS485 serial link</strong> that supports the industry standard <strong>MODBUS RTU</strong> protocol. There are LED local indications for all digital inputs.</p>

            <img src="/assets/images/products/smartcomm/avatar3.png" class="col-md-6" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 50px;"/>
        </li>
        <li style="clear: both;">
            Out of the 8 nos trip inputs, the <strong>“first-in”</strong> that triggered the pump-trip is available in a Modbus message.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Device has a 1.3” OLED display activated by PIR (movement sensor)</strong> to display all critical device parameters.</p>

        </li>
        <li>Long back-up time exceeding <strong>30 minutes @ 30Watts.</strong></li>
        <li>OPTIONAL<strong> WIFI module</strong> to transmit the digital input signals through a wireless network.</li>
        <li>Both the digital inputs and serial communications are <strong>galvanically isolated</strong> for enhanced safety.</li>
        <li>Can be operated from -30 to + 65 Deg C ambient temperature. </li>
        <li>Low heat dissipation and quiet operation.</li>
        <li>Environment friendly <strong>(ROHS compliant)</strong> energy storage and no battery disposal concerns due to absence of metals like Cadmium, Lead, Nickel or Lithium.</li>
        <li><strong>Small in size and lighter</strong> compared to solar or conventional battery based back-up systems where panels and heavy storage batteries are involved.</li>
        <li>No maintenance required unlike other conventional systems (against periodic solar panel dust cleaning, storage battery replacements). </li>
        <li>Gives <strong>long service life, can withstand charge-discharge cycles > 500,000 </strong> compared to just 1000 to 3000 cycles for a conventional battery based system.</li>
        <li><strong>Theft or tampering</strong> is not likely since no storage batteries are involved (storage battery theft is a well-known problem at remote well sites).</li>
        <li>Both <strong>24VDC and 12VDC</strong> versions are available. Some RPCs (Rod Pump Controller) operate on 12VDC.</li>
